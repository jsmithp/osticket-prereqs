<p>
Open IIS as administrator. Register PHP inside of IIS. Stop and start server. Install osTicket. Extract "uploads" folder to C:\inetpub\wwwroot. Rename the folder "osTicket". Reload IIS (Stop and start server). Go to: sites > default > osTicket; on the far right of the window, click on "Browse*:80". Go to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php and rename "ost-sampleconfig.php" to "ost-config.php". Next, you will need to enable PHP extensions before continuing with osTicket. Go back to IIS and go to "sites > default > osTicket. Double click on PHP manager and then click on "Enable or disable an extension". Assign file permissions to everyone (Disable inheritance > Remove All, New Permissions > Everyone > All). Enable "php_imap.dll", "php_intl.dll" and "php_opcache.dll". If you refresh the browser, osTicket's PHP extension changes will be shown.

<p>
Start filling out the form in os Ticket. Before you complete the form, you'll need a database client. Install HeidiSQL. Open HeidiSQL and create a new database using the name and password you created for MySQL. Connect to session and create a database called "osTicket". Now that you've created a database you can now finish filling out the form. Use your MySQL name and password on the form. Click install now. Browse to your help desk login page: http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php. There's a little bit of cleanup necessary before you proceed. Delete: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup. Set permissions to “Read, Read and execute" at : C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php.
